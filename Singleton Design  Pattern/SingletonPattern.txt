Problem - Design a class for which there is only one instance.

Singleton Pattern - It ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point
of access to it.

For thread safety in multi-threaded environment there are three methods used to implement
Singleton class.

1. Create an instance of Singleton in static initializer.

2. Synchronize the method for getting instance. But Synchronizing a method can decrease
performance by considerable factor.

3. First check if instance is created if not then, then synchronize the instance creation.
