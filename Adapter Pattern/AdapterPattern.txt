Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface
the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise
because of incompatible interfaces.

This acts to decouple the client from the implemented interface, and if
we expect the interface to change over time, the adapter encapsulates that
change over time so that client doesn't have to be modified each time.

Kinds of Adapter

Object Adapters:
In this, adaptor class is subclass of Target_interface and uses composition by
keeping object of Adaptee (actual_interface)


Class Adapters:
Class Adapters needs multiple inheritance to implement it.
In this, instead of using composition Adapter subclasses the Adaptee and 
Target_interface
